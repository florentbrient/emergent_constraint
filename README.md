__This project aims to provide statistical inferences for emergent constraints.__  
Git project creation 12 Feb 2019
Statistical inferences consists in two methods:
The first uses uncertainties underlying the observational predictor and project it onto the vertical axis using the emergent constraint relationship
The second consists of estimating a posterior distribution by weighting each model's response by the likelihood of the model given the observations of the predictor. This can be done through information theory, i.e. the Kullback-Leibler divergence as coded in Brient and Schneider (16).

## Description

### Main directory
The main repository contains this __README.md__ file and three folders: __src__, __text__ and __figures__.

### src
The src folder contains the Python modules

## plot_random_EC.py
This routine is used to calculcate statistical inferences from an idealized randomly-generated relationship between and predictor A and a predictand B.

## binning_inference.py

## plot_PDF_ECS.py
